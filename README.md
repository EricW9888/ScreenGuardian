# ScreenGuardian Code and assets. 
**The app has been compiled into a ".EXE" file using "pyinstaller" so paths to files were cut down to accommodate other computers. The ".EXE" application is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10AlpPePMYZLcmPhThd7CXxPbSsZ306ep?usp=drive_link**
To run the ".py" file in an IDE, several libraries, modules, and DLLs must be installed, please refer to the "imports" at the top of "ScreenGuardian.py" for details.
